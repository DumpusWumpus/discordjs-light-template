This is a bot template for smaller Discord bots, it features support for slash and text commands.

It uses [discord.js-light](https://github.com/timotejroiko/discord.js-light) to minimize caching and [slash-create](https://github.com/Snazzah/slash-create) to handle slash commands. Features argument parsers for getting things like numbers or mentions from user input as well as a powerful component collector that lets you listen for clicks on buttons/menus or paginate an array of messages automatically.

Can be easily upgraded to support larger bots, you just need to cluster the bot using a package like [discord-hybrid-sharding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-hybrid-sharding).
